# We may come across a situation where we want to enable this feature because
# a particular driver or device requires udev to do some additional work
# in userspace in order to load an updated firmware image.  If this option
# is enabled it will result in 60 second timeouts for all devices that do
# not find an image on the filesystem.  For example the x86 microcode driver
# will timeout for every CPU on the system:
#
# [  253.516631] microcode: CPU4 sig=0x206f2, pf=0x4, revision=0x26
# [  313.684795] microcode: CPU5 sig=0x206f2, pf=0x4, revision=0x26
# [  373.876289] microcode: CPU6 sig=0x206f2, pf=0x4, revision=0x26
# [  434.046824] microcode: CPU7 sig=0x206f2, pf=0x4, revision=0x26
# [  494.216002] microcode: CPU8 sig=0x206f2, pf=0x4, revision=0x26
# [  554.386315] microcode: CPU9 sig=0x206f2, pf=0x4, revision=0x26
# etc.
#
# Upstream has introduced request_firmware_direct() which will not delay 60
# seconds, however, each use of request_firmware() in the tree will have to be
# audited for possible replacement.
#
# In other words ... proceed at your own risk.
